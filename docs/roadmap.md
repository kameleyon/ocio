# OptimusCode.io Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
OptimusCode.io is a web platform that generates full-stack MVP web applications from natural language prompts. Users describe the app they want, and our system analyzes the request, generates the app (plan, files, frontend/backend, DB), displays a live preview, and provides a downloadable zip of the complete application.

## Technical Details

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Node.js
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **AI Integration**: OpenRouter API (Claude models)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (planned)

### Architecture
The application follows a client-server architecture with:
- Next.js for frontend and API routes
- Supabase for database and authentication
- OpenRouter for AI code generation
- File system operations for project bundling

### Code Structure
- `/app`: Next.js app router pages and API routes
- `/components`: Reusable UI components
  - `/components/ui`: Base UI components
  - `/components/landing`: Landing page components
  - `/components/build`: Build interface components
  - `/components/dashboard`: Dashboard components
- `/lib`: Utilities, services, and helpers
  - `/lib/services`: Core services (auth, project, AI)
  - `/lib/services/generators`: App generation logic
  - `/lib/utils`: Helper utilities for API error handling, rate limiting, webhooks
  - `/lib/supabase`: Database connection and schema definitions
- `/middleware`: Authentication and route protection
- `/public`: Static assets
- `/docs`: Documentation (this roadmap)

## Next Steps
1. Add user account management UI
2. Create payment integration for premium tiers and top up token
3. Implement usage analytics dashboard
4. Create unit tests for core services
5. Configure production deployment

## Implementation Details

### App Generation System (Completed)
- **Prompt Generation**: Structured prompts for optimal AI code generation
- **Code Validation**: Security checks, best practices enforcement
- **File Generation**: Smart template-based file structure creation
- **Tech Stack Templates**: React, Next.js, and MERN stack support
- **Zip Creation**: Automated packaging with proper structure

### Frontend Enhancements (Completed)
