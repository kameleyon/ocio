# OptimusCode.io Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
OptimusCode.io is a web platform that generates full-stack MVP web applications from natural language prompts. Users describe the app they want, and our system analyzes the request, generates the app (plan, files, frontend/backend, DB), displays a live preview, and provides a downloadable zip of the complete application.

- ✅ Particle background animation
- ✅ Dark mode theme with custom color palette

#### Landing Page
- ✅ Hero Section with animated prompt
- ✅ Navbar with responsive mobile menu
- ✅ Features Section with cards
- ✅ Demo Preview section
- ✅ Process Timeline
- ✅ Pricing Section
- ✅ Footer

#### Authentication
- ✅ Login page and form component
- ✅ Signup page and form component

- ❌ Add support for different tech stack templates

#### Frontend
- ❌ Create loading/progress indicators during generation
- ❌ Build interactive app preview component
- ❌ Implement real-time status updates during generation
- ❌ Add user account management UI
- ❌ Create payment integration for premium tiers

#### Testing & Deployment
- ❌ Create unit tests for core services
- ❌ Implement integration tests
- ❌ Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Immediate)
1. Complete the build interface for prompt input and processing
2. Implement the LLM integration for code generation
3. Develop the file bundling and zip creation logic
4. Create the app preview component
5. Finish user authentication flow

### Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience (Short-term)
1. Add real-time progress indicators
2. Implement project storage and management
3. Create user dashboard with project history
4. Add ability to modify/regenerate previous projects
5. Improve error handling and user feedback

### Phase 3: Platform Expansion (Medium-term)
1. Implement subscription/payment tiers
2. Add support for multiple tech stacks
3. Create template customization options
4. Implement team collaboration features
5. Add analytics for user projects

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features (Long-term)
1. Develop custom deployment options
2. Add integration with version control systems
3. Create enterprise admin dashboard
4. Implement advanced security features
5. Add API for third-party integrations

## Technical Details

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Node.js, Express (for specific services)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **AI Integration**: OpenRouter API
- **Deployment**: TBD (likely Vercel or similar)

### Architecture
The application follows a client-server architecture with:
- Next.js for frontend and API routes
- Supabase for database and authentication
- OpenRouter for AI code generation
- File system operations for project bundling

### Code Structure
- `/app`: Next.js app router pages and API routes
- `/components`: Reusable UI components
- `/lib`: Utilities, services, and helpers
- `/public`: Static assets
- `/docs`: Documentation (this roadmap)

## Next Steps
1. Complete the build interface implementation
2. Integrate OpenRouter API for code generation
3. Implement project storage and retrieval
4. Create zip file generation functionality
5. Add live preview capabilities

## Open Questions
- How will we handle resource limits for generated apps?
- What deployment options should we offer users?
- How can we ensure security of generated code?
- What pricing tiers make sense for the platform?
